		We are delighted to announce that in August 2021 the Flax Bourton Hub
		received Â£5000 of funding from the National Lottery. We plan to use 100% of
		this funding to keep our facilities maintained and suitable for all the
		activities taking place at the Hub that you see shown here. We'd be
		delighted to hear your ideas for new activities - send us your ideas at
		<a href="mailto:bookings@flaxbourtonhub.org">bookings@flaxbourtonhub.org</a
		>'
	</p>
	<p>
		Thank you to all the National Lottery players for making this grant possible
