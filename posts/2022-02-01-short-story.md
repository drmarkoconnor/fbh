He looked at the leafy tongues of the frangipani and imagined them stuck out, mocking him. He glanced at the bright titanium white of the tea-roses at his side. English roses. Such a difficult beginning, but he had seen them blossom at last and endure. His wife never saw them bloom. They had argued about that.

       ‘Prune hard, thicken the roots. Make them hardy.’

       ‘I know darling, but I should so like to see a bloom to colour this depressing beige.’

       A firm stance needed. Prune hard. For years, they were just little more than fattening sticks in ever larger pots.

       Slowly in this way, the Colonel and his wife talked less about the garden as it became more established under his strict timetable. She devoted her time to other things and as way leads onto way, time passed.

       Zephyr tucked the pashmina into his collar. As the promised warm mist began to descend, she checked he was within the evening shade cast from the villa.



In the early days, the Colonel’s parties were the talk of the regiment. It wasn’t unusual for some of the men to forgo leave to attend. Of course, they were the Captain’s parties when he first took up the commission. It was generally considered that the get-togethers were responsible for a remarkable camaraderie of his men and not least his promotions.

       ‘Who’s there?’ he said creeping up behind his wife and placing his hands over her eyes.

       ‘Darling, you gave me such a start.’ She tried to swivel around for the six o’clock welcome home kiss, but his grip on her head wouldn’t allow it. ‘Captain Crazy man, unhand me this instance.’

       ‘I think you mean Major Crazy man,’ he said, at which point he released her.

       ‘Major! They made you a Major?’

       ‘Yes, and another five-year commission.’

       ‘Oh darling, that’s wonderful. Well done us.’ She jumped into his arms and wrapped her legs tightly around his waist. ‘Spin me around and around. I couldn’t be dizzier than I am now anyway.’

       ‘Well that’s no way for a Major’s wife to behave now is it?’ he said, carefully placing her down onto the cool granite kitchen surface. ‘We’ll throw a party to welcome the new men, eh?’
